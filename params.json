Abbott-Smith's *A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament* (New York: Scribner's, 1922) using TEI. Contributors are welcome. This document records important source information and markup standards.\r\n\r\nSource and Copyright\r\n=\r\n\r\nThe PDF file with a text layer (manualgreeklexic00abborich.pdf) was obtained from http://archive.org/details/manualgreeklexic00abborich. Certain restrictions apply to the use of this file. These are included in the PDF file.\r\n\r\nThe lexicon (abbott-smith.tei.xml), including the marked up version in this repository, is in the public domain. \r\n\r\nViewing and Downloading\r\n=\r\n\r\nIt is not recommended that you use abbott-smith.tei.xml in this folder for anything but cleaning up and marking up entries because it contains text recognized by OCR that needs to be cleaned up. To use the lexicon, [view the current release online](http://www.textonline.org/files/abbott-smith/abbott-smith.current_release.xml) or download any release from the [Downloads page](https://github.com/translatable-exegetical-tools/Abbott-Smith/downloads).\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n=\r\n\r\nAll are welcome to contribute to this project by: \r\n* Cleaning up text generated by OCR\r\n* Adding XML markup\r\n* Proofreading marked up entries\r\n* Improving the XSL and CSS stylestheets\r\n* Forking the lexicon and translating it into another language\r\n\r\nThose interested should send an email to editors at textonline dot org (deleting the spaces and replacing \"at\" and \"dot\" with the appropriate characters). \r\n\r\nCurrent contributors include: \r\n* Daniel Owens\r\n* Dardo Sordi\r\n\r\nMarkup Information\r\n=\r\n\r\nAll text from the lexicon will be included and marked up using CrossWire.org's iteration of TEI XML, which supports several features of OSIS XML that are relevant to biblical studies (especially biblical references). For helpful documentation on this iteration of TEI, see http://www.crosswire.org/wiki/TEI_Dictionaries. For the schema definition, see http://www.crosswire.org/OSIS/teiP5osis.1.4.xsd. For detailed documentation on TEI dictionaries, see http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.html. \r\n\r\nNote that until markup is complete, the file will not validate because the &lt;body> and &lt;div> elements cannot contain text (only certain elements), but the text layer provides such text. However, a validator can be used to identify other problems in the document and the raw text be deleted if one wishes to work with text that has already been cleaned up.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=\r\n\r\n2012/09/01 - Release of v. 0.12: Includes pages iii-4 and entries for words occurring 300 times or more in the Greek NT. \r\n\r\n2012/08/07 - Release of v. 0.11: Includes pages iii-4 and entries for words occurring 500 times or more in the Greek NT.
